## Something about the final assignment

For the final assignment I have chosen to work with the human data file.

I have enjoyed the course as I have learned everything from R, R Markdown and Github from the beginning. But I would recommend for people without experience of the above mentioned techniques, that they use and plan some more time for the assignments.

Thank you for a great course

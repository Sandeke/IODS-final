## Something about the final assignment

During the course I had to learn everything from the beginning, as I didn't have any experience with **R**, **R Markdown** or **Github**. I understand now something about all the techniques and enjoy it, while I'm working with them on my own projects.

For the final assignment I have chosen to work with the 'human'-data file, according to the instructions in the last assignment.

Thank you for a great course!
